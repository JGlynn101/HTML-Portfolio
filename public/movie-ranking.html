<h2>Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>This movie is perfect. The acting, starring Amy Adams, the plot, the tension it builds
    and both the reality and breadth of the characters make this movie a favorite of mine.

<h3>Coach Carter</h3>
<p>I saw this movie as a 6 or 7 year old and loved it. It is a comfort movie I come back to occasionally when I need motivation.</p>
<h3>Dan In Real Life </h3>
<p>This movie is a Rom-Com and showcases my favorite actor's (Steve Carrell) versatility and range as an actor.</p>
